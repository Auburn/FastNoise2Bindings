# FastNoise2 Bindings
C# bindings for [FastNoise2](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise2) noise generation library

Uses the metadata system in FastNoise2 to reference node types and variable names, this means the bindings don't need to updated when there are new/changed nodes/variables in FastNoise2

[Example usage](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise2Bindings/blob/master/CSharp/test/BitmapGenerator.cs)
